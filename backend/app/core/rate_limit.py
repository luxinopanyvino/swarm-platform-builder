"""In-memory throttling for authentication endpoints.

Protects ``/auth/login`` and ``/auth/register`` against brute-force and
credential-stuffing attacks with two complementary controls:

* **Sliding-window rate limiting** per client identifier (IP) and action, so a
  single source cannot hammer the endpoints.
* **Account lockout** that temporarily blocks an account after a configurable
  number of consecutive failed logins, regardless of the source IP (defends
  against distributed credential stuffing against one account).

State is process-local (no external dependency). This is sufficient for a
single-worker deployment and for CI; a multi-worker/replicated production
deployment should back these stores with a shared store such as Redis. The
public helpers below intentionally read their thresholds from the caller so the
limits stay configurable (``app.core.config.settings``) and testable.
